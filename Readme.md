# Project Details
This project was created just for my practice. It is a basic application made with the following technologies:
* REACT for front-end
* Node Js for back-end
  * MongoDB for database
  * Express as a framework for node

## Features of this application
 This application performs basic CRUD operations.
 It can create book, update book, delete book and show the books. The ui of this application was not the priority. So, the ui is not fancy but it works in all sort of devices.
